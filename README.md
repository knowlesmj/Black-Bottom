This map is designed to represent the historic gentrification of the Black Bottom Neighberhood of West Philidelphia.
Using a historical database called [West Philidelphia Collaborative History](https://collaborativehistory.gse.upenn.edu/decades/1960s) , old historical maps were digtized on ArcGis Pro and then converted into geoJsons using [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20).
The features of the map itself depict a before and after the historic reneweal process of the 1960s using color. Green represents the areas that were bought using eminent domain law to take houses from the historic community.
Other features of the map include a hover feature that highlights on mouseover and a info box in the top right of the screen that further explainis each of the units described in the historic maps.
Overall, the map is intended to be simple, but clearly show the physical removal over time in the targeted gentrification of a minority community.
